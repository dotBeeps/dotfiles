# dot's dotfiles
---
These are my dotfiles, there are many like them, but these are mine. Dotfiles are system and application configuration files, this is my personal configuration. These are still very much a work in progress so be aware.  
  
## dotfile manager - chezmoi
---
I'm giving [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) a try. Don't have many thoughts on it yet but it seems very feature-rich.

## shell - quickshell
---
Tried AGS for a while but I'm not a fan of gnome's components and struggled to get a feel for how to write clean TSX with it. Decided to go with [quickshell](https://github.com/quickshell-mirror/quickshell) after having previously used soramane's amazing shell from [caelestia](https://github.com/caelestia-dots). Big thanks to them for publishing their dots, was a big inspiration for mine.
