# SDeck-CapyLock

A lock screen that showcases a 2-row numeric pad with a customizable background (solid color, gradient, or image) and top bar.

This theme is much less flexible than my CapyMenu themes but still offers a decent amount of options to tinker with. More layouts and features may be added in the future.

You can store your images wherever you want in `/home/deck/homebrew/themes/`
